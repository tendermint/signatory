## Installation

You will need to grab the appropriate yubihsm2-sdk release for your operating
system from Yubico's web site:

https://developers.yubico.com/YubiHSM2/Releases/

This crate was developed against libyubihsm v1.0.1 but should also support
newer versions.

If the YubiHSM2 SDK for your platform provides an OS package, install that
package. If not, unpack it under e.g. `/usr/local` and provide the following
environment variable whenever invoking `cargo build`:

```
YUBIHSM_SDK=/usr/local/yubihsm2-sdk
```
